## Setup
    - Obtain an API by going to the Discord Portal and making an application, then crating a bot and copying it's unique token given in the bot tab

    - Make a file called .env and put the text "DISCORD_TOKEN={YOUR_TOKEN_HERE}" inside the file

    - To run the bot youll need to have the "discord.py" package and "python-dotenv" installed
## Usage
    - You can type "is this real?" into the chat to get responses from the bot

    - the bot will then respond with various messges questioning existence and purpose


## Research
    - Simply running the bot in your terminal on your local system is fun for showing your friends your quirky new bot, but when it actually comes to having this bot available for others to use this is less practical

    - Realistically you would want this program running on a device you set up as a server, since this is such a low intensity program for this bot running it off of a rasberry pi is an excellent solution.
